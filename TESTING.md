## Testing

The program was tested constantly during its development process.
Other users also tested it in order to spot possible grammatical mistakes that the code may present.

### Validators

Valentin Bryukhanov's [online validation tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to ensure that all of the project's Python source code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator.


### Manually testing

1.Run the code in your Python environment.
2.The game will start with a welcome message and menu options.
3.Choose option 1 to see the rules of the game.
4.Press 1 again to go back to the main menu.
5.Choose option 2 to start the game.
6.Select a level (1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, 3 for Hard, 4 to Exit).
7.If you choose a level, the game will randomly select a word from the chosen level's word list and display the initial hangman state and word completion.
8.Enter a letter or word guess based on the displayed information.
9.Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of tries.
10.After the game ends (either in a win or a loss), you'll see the result and the option to play again.
