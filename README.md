## Features

  - **When the program is loaded**

  The user can see a welcoming message which engages to start playing and choose from options:

   1.Rules

   2.Start game

  ![Welcome message](documentation/welcome-message.png)

  - **When the user select an option**

  - If the user select number 1, shows in terminal the game rules.

  ![Rules](documentation/rules.png)
  
  - If the user select number 2, shows in terminal the level difficulties.

  ![Level difficulty](documentation/level-difficulty.png)

  In the context of the Hangman game, the different difficulty levels typically refer to the complexity or challenge presented to the player. Here's how the difficulty levels might be categorized:

    1. Easy: In this level, the secret word might be relatively short, and the player would have a higher number of attempts to guess the letters or the word. This level is suitable for beginners or those looking for a more relaxed gameplay experience.

    2. Medium: The secret word's length and complexity increase compared to the easy level. The player may have a moderate number of attempts to guess the word correctly. This level provides a balanced challenge for players with some familiarity with the game.

    3. Hard: This level offers a substantial challenge. The secret word can be quite long or include less common letters. The player may have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, making each choice critical. This level is ideal for experienced players seeking a tough challenge.

These difficulty levels add variety and cater to players with different skill levels, ensuring that both newcomers and seasoned players can enjoy the Hangman game according to their preferences and abilities.

  - **When the user select a level**

  - Depending on which level is chosen, the rules of the game are the same.

  - The game starting when the user select a level.


  - **Setup:**

  - A secret word is chosen by the secret-keeper.(In this case by computer). This  word is usually not revealed to the player.
  - The player is provided with the number of letters in the secret word, represented by underscores (_).
  - The player is also given a limited number of attempts (represented by the image of a hangman).

 ![Setup](documentation/setup.png)

  - **Guessing:**
  
  - The player starts guessing letters one by one. Each guess can be a single letter or an entire word.
  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - If the guessed letter is in the secret word, it is revealed in the correct positions.
  - If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman figure is drawn (head, body, arms, legs, etc.).
  - If the player guesses all the letters of the word correctly, they win the game.

  ![Right guess](documentation/guessing1.png)
  ![Wrong guess](documentation/guessing2.png)

 - **Winning and Losing:**
        
 - The player wins if they correctly guess the entire word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
 - The player loses if they use up all their attempts (the entire hangman figure is drawn) before correctly guessing the word.
 - When the game is end ,the terminal shows again the level difficulty and Quit option.

## Bugs 

+ **Solved bugs**

1. While coding, I encountered a bug where, upon pressing any key other than those expected, the terminal responded with the message "command not found".

![Bug](documentation/bug-python.png)

 - *Solution:* in some functions was added a while loop and continue statement

  ```python
   while True:
        choice = input(f"{colorama.Fore.YELLOW}Enter your choice (1 or 2): \n")
        if choice == "1":
            show_rules()
            print(f"{colorama.Fore.GREEN}1.{colorama.Style.RESET_ALL}Go back ðŸ”™")
            answer = input(
                f"{colorama.Fore.YELLOW}Enter number 1 to go back: \n")
            if answer == "1":
                clear_screen()
                welcome_message()

        elif choice == "2":
            main()
        else:
            print(f"{colorama.Fore.RED}Invalid choice. Please enter 1 or 2.")
            continue
  ```
 
 ![Solved Bug](documentation/solved-bug.png)

 

2. When the user want to go back from the rules and type any other key then expected, displaying to choose from number 1 or 2.

![Bug](documentation/bug222.png)

 - *Solution:* I made function ```wait_for_any_key``` and called in ```welcome_message``` at the right place.

 ```python
 def welcome_message():
     """
     Displays the welcome message and menu options to
     the player.
     """
     print(f"{colorama.Back.MAGENTA}Welcome to Hangman Game!ðŸ˜€")
     print(f"{colorama.Fore.GREEN}Options:{colorama.Style.RESET_ALL}")
     print(f"{colorama.Fore.GREEN}1.{colorama.Style.RESET_ALL} Rules")
     print(f"{colorama.Fore.GREEN}2.{colorama.Style.RESET_ALL} Start Game")

     while True:
         choice = input(f"{colorama.Fore.YELLOW}Enter your choice (1 or 2): \n")
         clear_screen()
         if choice == "1":
             show_rules()
             wait_for_any_key()
         elif choice == "2":
             main()
         else:
             print(f"{colorama.Fore.RED}Invalid choice. Please enter 1 or 2.")
             continue


 def wait_for_any_key():
     print(f"{colorama.Fore.YELLOW}Press any key to go back...")
     input()  # Wait for any key press
     clear_screen()
     welcome_message()
     ```

![Solved Bug](documentation/solved-bug2.png)


3. Function  ```clear_screen``` was not called at the right place ,so it was not working.

 - *Solution*: I called the function inside the right functions.


+ **Unsolved bugs**
   
  - None.
